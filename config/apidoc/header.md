## <a id="user-class"></a>üë§ User

In order to log in and create games, a user must be created (aka the future game master).

| updatedAt            | Date     | When the user updated his account.                                  |

## <a id="game-class"></a>üé≤ Game

A user can create as many games as he wants as long as he doesn't have a game with the status `playing`.

A game must contain at least **4 players** and can be customized by setting different `options`.

During the game, the `waiting` queue tells the game master what are the upcoming actions and players involved.

Each time a play is performed, `tick` increments and `phase` is set according to the current state. Game's `turn` increases after each succession of a `night` and a `day`.

Game ends when one of the following conditions is met, in this order of priority:

- All players are dead. 
- The angel is dead from the first `vote` or eaten by the `werewolves` during the first night. 
- Players with the `in-love` attribute are the only survivors.
- The pied piper is alive, not infected by the vile father of wolves or powerless, and all other survivors have the `charmed` attribute.
- The white werewolf is the only survivor.
- All players on `villagers` side are dead. 
- All players on `werewolves` side are dead. 

At the end of the game, winner(s) are set in the `won` property.

When game's status is `done` or `canceled`, it can be reviewed by the game master.

## <a id="player-class"></a>üê∫‚ö°üßô Player

At the start of the game, each player is either on the `side` of the `werewolves` or on the `side` of the `villagers` and must win with his `side`.

Each player has a `role` which can give him powers during the game. All roles are described in the [dedicated Player Roles section](#player-roles).

Due to some actions, players `role` and `side` can change during the game.

During the game, players can apply to each other `attributes` with many effects and duration. All attributes are described in the [dedicated Player Attributes section](#player-attributes).

When a player is killed, `isAlive` is set to `false` and `murdered` object is filled to tell the game master the source and cause of murder.
